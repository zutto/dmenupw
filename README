# tiny dmenu based password manager
---
### what is this?
This is a tiny script to encrypt & decrypt files in conveniently.
I made it to be a 'password manager', somewhere to store credentials for different services conveniently, but I already use it for much more than that.


### Security
The files are encrypted with your own cipher of choice (CIPHER variable on top of the code).
So the files are always as secure as your password is.

However, this is script itself is technically vulnerable to targetted timed attacks, use only on computers that you trust, this is what we pay for convenience.
If you really need to access the files and dont trust the machine, just use openssl to decode the files directly (openssl enc -CIPHER -d -in ~/PW_DIR/<file>), doing the decoding this way is still vulnerable to targetted attacks, but this would be 
much more difficult attack vector for the red team.



### Install
Modify the variables to your liking on top of the file, and copy the script over to your favorite user binary location (commonly /usr/local/bin/ is used).


#### Requirements:
1. bash
2. Openssl
3. dmenu
4. xsel (optional if you dont want to copy anything)
